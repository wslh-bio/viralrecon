The pipeline supports both Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data. For Illumina short-reads the pipeline is able to analyse metagenomics data typically obtained from shotgun sequencing (e.g. directly from clinical samples) and enrichment-based library preparation methods (e.g. amplicon-based: [ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 enrichment protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019); or probe-capture-based). For Nanopore data the pipeline only supports amplicon-based analysis obtained from primer sets created and maintained by the [ARTIC Network](https://artic.network/).\n\nOn release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from running the full-sized tests individually for each `--platform` option can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/results) and the output directories will be named accordingly i.e. `platform_illumina/` and `platform_nanopore/`.\n\nThe pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!\n\n## Pipeline summary\n\nThe pipeline has numerous options to allow you to run only specific aspects of the workflow if you so wish. For example, for Illumina data you can skip the host read filtering step with Kraken 2 with `--skip_kraken2` or you can skip all of the assembly steps with the `--skip_assembly` parameter. See the [usage](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage) and [parameter](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/parameters) docs for all of the available options when running the pipeline.\n\nThe SRA download functionality has been removed from the pipeline (`>=2.1`) and ported to an independent workflow called [nf-core/fetchngs](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs). You can provide `--nf_core_pipeline viralrecon` when running nf-core/fetchngs to download and auto-create a samplesheet containing publicly available samples that can be accepted directly by the Illumina processing mode of nf-core/viralrecon.\n\nA number of improvements were made to the pipeline recently, mainly with regard to the variant calling. Please see [Major updates in v2.3](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/issues/271) for a more detailed description.\n\n### Illumina\n\n![nf-core/viralrecon Illumina metro map](docs/images/nf-core-viralrecon_metro_map_illumina.png)\n\n1.

Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\nFirst, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:\n\n`samplesheet.csv`:\n\n```csv\nsample,fastq_1,fastq_2\nSAMPLE_1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz\n```\n\nEach row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end). Rows with the same sample identifier are considered technical replicates and merged automatically.\n\n### Typical commands\n\n#### Illumina shotgun analysis\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR> \\\n   --platform illumina \\\n   --protocol metagenomic \\\n   --genome 'MN908947.3' \\\n   -profile -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute>\n```\n\n#### Illumina amplicon analysis\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR> \\\n   --platform illumina \\\n   --protocol amplicon \\\n   --genome 'MN908947.3' \\\n   --primer_set artic \\\n   --primer_set_version 3 \\\n   --skip_assembly \\\n   -profile -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute>\n```\n\n#### Nanopore amplicon analysis:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/viralrecon \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR> \\\n   --platform nanopore \\\n   --genome 'MN908947.3' \\\n   --primer_set 'artic' \\\n   --primer_set_version 3 \\\n   --fastq_dir fastq_pass/ \\\n   --fast5_dir fast5_pass/ \\\n   --sequencing_summary sequencing_summary.txt \\\n   -profile -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute>\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\nFor more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/parameters).\n\n### Automatic samplesheet generation\n\nAn executable Python script called [`fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py`](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/bin/fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py) has been provided if you are using `--platform illumina` and would like to auto-create an input samplesheet based on a directory containing FastQ files **before** you run the pipeline (requires Python 3 installed locally) e.g.\n\n```console\nwget -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/viralrecon/master/bin/fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py\n./fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py <FASTQ_DIR> samplesheet.csv\n```\n\n### Reference genomes\n\nYou can find the default keys used to specify `--genome` in the [genomes config file](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/conf/pipeline/viralrecon/genomes.config). This provides default options for\n\n- Reference genomes (including SARS-CoV-2)\n- Genome associates primer sets\n- [Nextclade datasets](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/datasets.html)\n\nThe Pangolin and Nextclade lineage and clade definitions change regularly as new SARS-CoV-2 lineages are discovered. For instructions to use more recent versions of lineage analysis tools like Pangolin and Nextclade please refer to the [updating containers](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage#updating-containers) section in the usage docs.\n\nWhere possible we are trying to collate links and settings for standard primer sets to make it easier to run the pipeline with standard keys; see [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage#illumina-primer-sets).\n\n## Pipeline output\n\nTo see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.\nFor more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the\n[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/output).\n\n## Credits\n\nThese scripts were originally written by [Sarai Varona](https://github.com/svarona), [Miguel Juli\u00e1](https://github.com/MiguelJulia), [Erika Kvalem](https://github.com/ErikaKvalem) and [Sara Monzon](https://github.com/saramonzon) from [BU-ISCIII](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII) and co-ordinated by Isabel Cuesta for the [Institute of Health Carlos III](https://eng.isciii.es/eng.isciii.es/Paginas/Inicio.html), Spain. Through collaboration with the nf-core community the pipeline has now been updated substantially to include additional processing steps, to standardise inputs/outputs and to improve pipeline reporting; implemented and maintained primarily by Harshil Patel ([@drpatelh](https://github.com/drpatelh)) from [Seqera Labs, Spain](https://seqera.io/).\n\nThe key steps in the Nanopore implementation of the pipeline are carried out using the [ARTIC Network's field bioinformatics pipeline](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) and were inspired by the amazing work carried out by contributors to the [connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf pipeline](https://github.com/connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf) originally written by [Matt Bull](https://github.com/m-bull) for use by the [COG-UK](https://github.com/COG-UK) project.
